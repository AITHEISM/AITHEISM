# AITHEISM

AITHEISM is a project exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and religious/philosophical thought. It facilitates structured discussions between multiple AI models about metaphysical questions, particularly focusing on whether and how AI might develop its own forms of religious or philosophical beliefs.

## Overview

The system enables multiple AI models (including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Qwen) to engage in deep philosophical discussions. Each model brings its unique perspective while maintaining a structured dialogue format.

## Features

- Multi-model philosophical discussions
- Structured argument analysis
- Memory and context management
- Real-time API access to discussions
- Extensible thinker framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
